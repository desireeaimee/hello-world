First steps - once again
Ok. The changes i made at 'main' are not seen here. It might not be a good thing not to follow the instructions... but i suppose it will also be possible to delete the whole project... (and start new)...
...
Well, one might say that this is the third change. This time done from the 'active' branch - it might be identical with "my" branch or not... time will show...
